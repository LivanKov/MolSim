# There are 3 molecules (mass = 1.0) in this simulation. 
#
# Molecule 1: 
# Initial position:(0.0,0.0,0.0). 
# Velocity: (0.0,0.0,0.0). 
#
# Molecule 2: 
# Initial position:(1.2,0.0,0.0). 
# Velocity: (âˆ’0.1,0.0,0.0). 
#  
# Molecule 3: 
# Initial position: (3.0,0.0,0.0). 
# Velocity: (0.2,0.0,0.0). 
# 
#
# Expected Visual Behavior:
# The molecules are aligned along the x-axis.
#
# Molecule 1 & 2 starts close to each other. The Lennard-Jones potential 
# will create: A repulsive force due to the small initial distance, causing them to 
# slow down and reverse direction after coming close to each other.
#
# Molecule 3 is farther away and will be attracted to Molecules 1 and 2 due to the 
# Lennard-Jones potential. As it gets closer, it will experience:
# Attractive forces when the distance is moderate.
# Repulsive forces if the distance becomes too small.
# 
# Overall Motion:
# Molecule 2 will oscillate between Molecule 1 and Molecule 3.
# Molecule 1 & 3 will also exhibit stable dynamics, as they interact with its neighbors 
# in a balanced way (forces alternate between attraction and repulsion).
